/**
 * This package contains some examples building on top of the high level lsquic bindings. <br>
 * These examples include: <br>
 * * an echo server + client ({@link jquic.example.echo}) <br>
 * * a generic quic proxy ({@link jquic.example.generic}) <br>
 * * a http server + client + proxy ({@link jquic.example.http}) <br>
 * * a annotation based http server + proxy ({@link jquic.example.http.annotated}) <br>
 * * some examples using those (directly inside this package). Note, that these examples were created quite some time ago and might be broken by now. Please report any problems you encounter to us :)
